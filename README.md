Medicine-DB is a personalized inventory web app designed to manage information about medicines, orders, and a static bank balance. It allows users to add product payments and preview how they will appear. The app is built using Flask and SQLite.

## Description
Medicine-DB is a Spanish-language web application (although the code is written in English) that provides a user-friendly interface for managing inventory-related information.
